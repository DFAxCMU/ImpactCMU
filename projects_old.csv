Our group runs cybersecurity clinics specifically catered towards activists, providing general education/advice as well as personalized support. Weâ€™re also seeking other ways to best educate the Pittsburgh activist community about cybersecurity. We have run 4 clinics so far -- 3 stand-alone (March 2017, Apr 2017, and May 2017) and 1 at Pittsburgh's Summit Against Racism (Jan 2018).",

Ohio is one such case, and we regularly see Ohio patients coming to Pittsburgh for their abortions. Volunteer clinic escorts at Allegheny Reproductive Health Center (AHRC) often get requests to drive patients home after their appointment. This is done manually, on a case by case basis, resulting in a lot of overhead for administrative workers at the clinic. In this project, we are working closely with AHRC to develop an application that significantly automates the process of finding volunteer rides for patients. The system should be flexible and general enough that it can eventually be deployed across the country, so that volunteer drivers can be found to accommodate the longer trips necessitated by abortion legislation.",

Despite protests and Whole Foods pulling out of the deal due to bad publicity, LG demolished Penn Plaza Apartments and the site has remained vacant ever since. Meanwhile, the Penn Plaza Support and Action Coalition (PPSAC) has been fighting for new affordable housing on the former Penn Plaza site, as well as for former residents' right to return. We are doing data analyses and visualizations that support the notion that housing displacement, caused particularly by wealthier White gentrifiers moving into lower income Black neighborhoods, is a damaging pattern. We are also developing visualizations that drive home the human impact of housing displacement. So far, we have created a flyer containing analyses of census data, which clearly shows important patterns that can be used to decide zone policies for East Liberty and projects which are accepted by Planning Commissions. This flyer was handed out to several hundred people at the first public community hearing for LG Realty's new Revised Amended Preliminary Land Development Plan (RAPLDP).",
4/4/2018 10:14:56,Engineers Without Borders,,http://cmuewb.org/,Urban Agriculture,"Pittsburgh and many other urban areas suffer from food insecurity. 47% of Pittsburgh consists of food deserts, areas where residents do not have easy access to fresh, affordable produce due to income, the terrain, and availability of fresh produce vendors. The Urban Agriculture team seeks to help solve this problem using local growing. Our goal is to design and build indoor urban growth systems using hydroponic techniques to implement in the local Pittsburgh community. We are in the research and design phase of the project, and have gained experience and knowledge with LED lighting, different growth mediums, and aeroponic and hydroponic techniques. We are working towards partnering with local food banks and community centers to work towards implementation.","Project Leads: Jack Ronayne, Nina Prakash, Transitioning Project Leads: Emily Albergo, Theodore Gonzales-Tapley"

Students in inner city areas, especially in Pittsburgh, do not have access to sufficient educational opportunities as students in other areas. Additionally, many students may not be motivated to achieve academically. Our organization is dedicated to closing that gap and increasing motivation. Specifically, Amy Coronado has launched a computer science curriculum within Higher Achievement, teaching students coding and providing laptops. Additionally, Amanda Lee is launching a pre-college mentorship program, where we are hoping to open students to a wider range of opportunities after high school. In terms of the results, Higher Achievement tutoring has shown that on average, students involved in the program have increased the average grades by a full letter grade.

4/7/2018 15:04:36,Global Medical Brigades,"The mission of our organization is to empower rural communities in Central America to lead more independent and fulfilling lives. Since 2009, CMU GMB has traveled to such rural communities over spring break to organize and facilitate mobile medical clinics. Our chapter of Global Medical Brigades strives to fulfill a variety of goals throughout the course of our trip. In general, we aim to improve the standards of living in rural areas and empower the people who live there. Specifically, we aim to promote a sustainable healthcare system and improve standards of living. 

During the medical portion of our trip, students run clinics to help provide free medical, dental, and vision care to the surrounding communities. These tasks include directing patient flow, taking patient vitals and symptoms for use by the physician, entering patient information and demographics into the Global Brigades electronic health records system, conducting vision evaluations, distributing eyeglasses to community members with matching prescriptions, assisting dentists, and distributing medicine alongside a pharmacist.
 
During the public health portion of our trip, we collaborate with community workers to improve in-home infrastructures that will help prevent common illnesses. Projects include construction of eco-stoves, latrines, water storage units, showers, and concrete floors. The public health and medical portions of our trip complement each other well because many of the diseases our doctors see in the clinic are a result of the unhygienic and old facilities in the communities.",https://cmuglobalmedicalbrigades.weebly.com/,Global Medical Brigades: Nicaragua 2018,"We aim to improve the standards of living in rural Nicaragua and empower the people who live there.

Our highly skilled volunteers work with communities to find appropriate solutions for their infrastructure needs.,,PET Thatch ,"Waste management and recycling systems in developing countries are often not at capacity to process the wastes generated from increased consumption of goods such as bottled beverages and plastic bags. Though manufactured goods have made an increased quality of life for most people, it poses a health hazard and socioeconomic barrier to others who have to burn or sort recyclables from general waste bins. The goal of the project is to design and build a mechanism that will take plastic bottles and process them into building materials. Instead of recycling, we are trying to streamline the upcycling process and have researched and prototyped some designs.

4/9/2018 8:20:18,,,,Puerto Rico Spring Break Relief Trip,"Puerto Rico Spring Break Relief was a service and learning trip focused on agroecological, energy and infrastructure sustainability in the face of climate change caused destruction. After Hurricane Maria devastated the island, weaknesses in Puerto Ricoâ€™s current disaster relief plan and infrastructure, as well as the US governmentâ€™s recovery policies, became incredibly evident. Five months after the storm, more than 400,000 Puerto Ricans did not have power and many communities still do not have running water. Tiffany Taulton, a first year Masters in Public Policy Management in Heinz and our trip leader,
recognized through her frustration with the lack of efficient relief that a lot could be learned about climate resilience planning from Puerto Rico, and that there was a lot that we, as students, could do to help the island recover. From this, she developed a concept for a spring break trip to Puerto Rico focused on understanding the deficits within policy and infrastructure that caused the prolonged recovery and how we as future environmental planners, government leaders, and engineers could change these issues to improve the process.  Our team was composed of 13 CMU undergraduate and graduate students and a representative from the Homewood Childrenâ€™s Village, a Pittsburgh nonprofit that supports the children of Homewood.  Upon returning to campus, we have been sharing the stories of the Puerto Ricans we met and how people on the continental U.S. can give support to the island.",Tiffany Taulton; Luisa Gaburri; Montana Howard; Mengyu Chen; Krishna Dave; Laura Aldrete; Christina Ou; Claire Jacquillat; Laila Archuleta; Meghan Clark; Kenneth Wells; Caroline Morin; Ariana Sabbat; Peijin Wei

Water brigades in part of this larger organization and concerns itself with implementing infrastructure to provide clean water to communities that do not currently have access. In the four years we have been active, CMU's chapter of Global Water Brigades has traveled to Honduras and Nicaragua over spring break to work alongside community members to implement clean water systems. ",https://www.waterbrigades.org/,Global Water Brigades,"Clean water is critical to health, disease prevention, and personal hygiene. Community members currently travel up to two hours a day to acquire water that is acceptable for consumption. Due to weather events including flood and drought, access to water is unpredictable and unstable. Running water has economic implications as well. Women and children are typically responsible for collecting water. With access to running water, women and children can devote more time to education and professional pursuits. Access to water provides a foundation for further sustainable development, with the goal of improving the quality of life for individuals in these communities. Global Brigades' mission is to empower communities by supporting them with resources to create sustainable change. Community members form the committees facilitated by Global Brigades so that once Global Brigades leaves, the community has the tools to promote and maintain sustainable development. We work alongside community members to implement infrastructure to deliver clean, running water, and also participate in conversations with the locals to learn more about their lives and provide some advice on how to preserve the water project.
