            If you would like to submit a project to ImpactCMU, we ask that you pre-register with a brief description of your project by April 5th.

The materials for your projectâ€™s Instagram post must be submitted by April 26th. Each project will have 1 dedicated post, in which you may add a carousel of up to 10 photos and videos. Here are some examples of what a post can look like, and templates that you may use. These templates are optional. There are no strict guidelines for what your post should look like- we only ask that it tells a compelling narrative about your project. Feel free to be creative!
